Simple case without PPO
=========================

A.
have 1 publisher with 1000 subscribers
publish one message from the subscriber using a HUb.
Measure the average time it takes for each / all subscribers to get the message.

B.
1 person that follows 1000 people
and each of these 1000 people sending a message at the same time

This is the case where maybe we could use apache benchmark, simulating
that a person receives 1000 HTTP POST at the same time, without
considering where the POSTs comes from.



Notes
======

1. Clients are not wroten in PHP
